-- For the functor, foldable and unfoldable instances, we have to assume
-- throughout that the list fed to the backward pass has the same length
-- as the outputted one. Hence the many incomplete pattern matches.
--- Haven't figured out a user-friendly to ensure it
-- (using fixed size lists using some kind of type level natural works, but
--  can't be used in the very common case where that length is not fixed at compile
--  time. Though Data.Reflection and GHC.TypeLits do provide some ways to deal with
--  that, it's not enough for my use case.)
-- Also requires somewhat janky instances for AdditiveGroup and VectorSpace.
-- To be fixed eventually with a proper fixed size list interface, so at least users
-- have type safety (though library code itself doesn't).
